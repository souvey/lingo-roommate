# Lingo RoomMate

This is an extremely thrown-together prototype of a 3D level editor for https://lingothegame.com/index.html

I don't recommend trying to dig into the code at this stage: the goal was rapid prototyping, so it's very ugly and hard to follow. Lots of missing abstractions and hacks. Needs major refactoring if I decide to build this out further.
